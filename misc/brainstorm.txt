Roadmap:
    Endogenous candidate existence:
        candidate existence as function of voter ideologies
        ex: 
            2 normal dist. of voters in ideology vec space (IVS)
            1 normal dist of candidates in IVS
            candidates do 1(+?) step bounded distance optimization to capture more voters
            voters' likelihood to bullet vote (or otherwise vote non-honestly) correlated with ideology


What to model?

    Candidates: far L, center L, center R, far R i.e. 2-4 candidates (possibly 2-7 with independents: liberatarians, greens, billionaires etc.)

    Utilities: peaked at one candidate, trough at opposing party candidates, unknown for others
        How do we understand these utilities in order to make regret calculations somehow meaningful?
            -economically? (expected vs actual return on election? seems unrealistic to model people's prefernces on this basis)
            -normalized self-reported utilities
            -tradit'l utility of immediate outcome of election (~ happiness at reading headline)
        Ideally other conclusions are relatively unaffected by above choice

    Disenfranchisement as result of sub-optimal voting:
        -By regret
        -By likelihood of shifting vote i.e. probabilistic impact/voice calculation

What voting methods are transparent?
    What do we mean by this? (can get estimate of election from subset of population? Simplicity? etc.)

'Lau and Redlawsk (1997; 2006) “found that about 70% of voters, on average, chose the candidate who best matched their own expressed preferences.” (p. 40)'
'He found that about 3% of voters were clearly classiffiable as “ideologues,” with another 12% qualifying as “near-ideologues”; the vast majority of voters (and an even larger proportion of nonvoters) seemed to think about parties and candidates in terms of group interests or the “nature of the times,” or in ways that conveyed “no shred of policy significance whatever” (Converse 1964, 217–218; also Campbell et al. 1960, chap. 10).”'
'Another interesting point they make is that it is usually the least-informed voters who decide who wins an election because the non-partisan swing voters tend to be relatively uninformed (p. 312, also p.32).'
