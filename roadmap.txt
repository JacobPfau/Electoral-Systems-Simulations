What to model?

    Candidates: far L, center L, center R, far R i.e. 2-4 candidates (possibly 2-7 with independents: liberatarians, greens, billionaires etc.)

    Utilities: peaked at one candidate, trough at opposing party candidates, unknown for others
        How do we understand these utilities in order to make regret calculations somehow meaningful?
            -economically? (expected vs actual return on election?)
            -preferences with intensity? (~ normalized self-reported utilities)
            -tradit'l utility of immediate outcome of election (~ happiness at reading headline)
        Ideally other conclusions are relatively unaffected by above choice

    Disenfranchisement as result of sub-optimal voting:
        -By regret
        -By likelihood of shifting vote i.e. probabilistic impact/voice calculation
